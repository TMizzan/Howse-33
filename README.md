==========================================================================

Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Howse 33 is a sample game built using the Corona SDK.  It is a single player game
where the user plays against the Howse.  The objective of the game is similar to Blackjack except the winning card total is 33.  Face Cards are worth 11 and all other cards have their face value.   The user
has  the option to Hit or Freeze.   Bets are placed before each hand in increments of $5, $10, $25, $50, or $100.   Each hand begins with 3 cards and a player can acquire a maximum of 5 cards.
The game begins with $1000 at your disposal.  No Thank You needed for the virtual cash!
